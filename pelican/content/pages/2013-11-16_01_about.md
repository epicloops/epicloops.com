loops and samples.__

Everyone has _that something_. That something that brings them back and keeps them going. That something that centers them
and inspires them to push the limits of their craft. For an athlete, it might be a tough workout. For a writer, it might
be a freewrite. For producers, it's almost certainly digging.

You'd be hard pressed to find an experience that replaces digging through the crates. Even for non-samplers, the
inspiration that can come from an afternoon of digging can be unparalleled. Something about an obscure track--pressed to
vinyl blemishes and all--gets the juices flowing in a way the polish of a professionally recorded loop or vst plugin
can't recreate.

But there's a vast sea of tracks that will never be found through digging. In today's world, musicians are creating
thousands of riffs and melodies everyday and sharing them online, often under Creative Commons licenses that are
sample-friendly. They exist only in digital form and require a digital form of digging to unearth.

At epicloops, we are building tools that simplify the process of digging through audio that has been shared online.
First, we crawl the web looking for audio that has been licensed under a
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY-SA</a> license. Then, we
analyze the audio to find the beats and measures that would make the best samples. Finally, we
classify each sample based on genre, instrument, tempo, etc. and provide them as organized collections.

In the near future we will be bringing these tools to the forefront so that you can use them directly.
Stay tuned. __The dig has just begun...__
